Phusion Passenger
=================

Before setting up the server itself you need to run some commands:

1. `rake source` if you are going to use dev.throttle.localhost
2. `rake build` if you are going to use prod.throttle.localhost
3. `rake certificate` to get a self-signed certificate generated on /etc folder
      Note: this last step requires interaction

Now make sure Passenger is correctly installed and set up in your server.

It is needed to set up HTTPS in order to use the web client, since it stores
secure cookies to maintain sessions. With the previous command `rake certificate`
that we did run before, our certificate file and key has been generated at
/etc/server.crt and /etc/server.key respectively.

Following a configuration example for both Apache and nginx servers:

  Apache
  ------

    NameVirtualHost *:443

    <VirtualHost *:443>
      ServerName prod.throttle.localhost
      DocumentRoot /path/to/throttle/throttle/passenger-prod/public/
      SSLEngine on
      SSLCertificateFile /etc/server.crt
      SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/server.key
      <Directory /path/to/throttle/throttle/passenger-prod/public/>
        AllowOverride all
        Options -MultiViews
      </Directory>
    </VirtualHost>

    <VirtualHost *:443>
      ServerName dev.throttle.localhost
      DocumentRoot /path/to/throttle/throttle/passenger-dev/public/
      SSLEngine on
      SSLCertificateFile /etc/server.crt
      SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/server.key
      <Directory /path/to/throttle/throttle/passenger-dev/public/>
        AllowOverride all
        Options -MultiViews
      </Directory>
    </VirtualHost>


  nginx
  -----

    http {
        passenger_root /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/passenger-2.2.15;
        passenger_ruby /usr/bin/ruby;

        server {
            listen 443;
            ssl on;
            ssl_certificate /etc/server.crt;
            ssl_certificate_key /etc/server.key;
            server_name prod.throttle.localhost;
            passenger_enabled on;
            root /path/to/throttle/throttle/passenger-prod/public;
        }

        server {
            listen 443;
            ssl on;
            ssl_certificate /etc/server.crt;
            ssl_certificate_key /etc/server.key;
            server_name dev.throttle.localhost;
            passenger_enabled on;
            root /path/to/throttle/throttle/passenger-dev/public;
        }
    }
